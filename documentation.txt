PSA: I worked A LOT on the 867 bookmark to try and make the conquest more flavoury. I've made A LOT of changes and added stuff without testing the 1066 bookmark once. The 1066 bookmark MIGHT BE BROKEN right now. I'll try and get on that when I feel fully satisfied with the Aegon's Conquest 867 start.

I might disable 1066 for a while I'm not sure yet.

[list]
    [*]New dragon conquest CB

    [*]House Hoare CoA

    [*]New death reason (burned alive) with lil icon

    [*]New Decision: Conquer the Seven Kingdoms

    Basically it unlocks the dragon conquest CB, gives you the "the iron throne" title, gives you the london title and renames it to aegonfort.

    [*]New events: Aegon's Conquest events

    There's 1 event per kingdom and they trigger automatically when you vassalize one of them with the dragon cb, some dynasty prestige, some flavour stuff (haven't gone too deep into rewards for every conquest yet, out of ideas atm)

    1 event that triggers when you conquer the last of the 7. There's 2 options
    either move capital to aegonfort (london) and rename it to king's landing, 2k dynasty prestige and stay as the iron throne.
    or you make the New Valyria empire title instead
    
    Both of those options trigger the last event which is just the coronation, gives the conqueror nickname and blackfyre crown etc same old.
    
    [*]Fixed blackfyre 

    [*]Updated bunch of icons

    [*]Replaced the weird placeholder giants with the Kings of westeros from lore.

I work on this here and there in my free time. Leave any ideas and suggestions in the comments. 99% I won't touch any custom 3D model ideas, it's too far outside my comfort zone (includes dragons as separate characters because I don't think you can use 2D portraits). None of the art is original work by me. Some icons are from the CK2 AGOT mod, some just art from google I've put over default icons or even default icons I've recolered. Most of the illustrations is art I found on google, some from the awoiaf. If anyone wants to be credited or is wondering where the art is from let me know and I will find it and add it.

[h1] Old Valyria [/h1] adds [b] Aegon "the Conqueror" Targaryen [/b] on Dragonstone as the liege to Lord of the Tides [b] Daemon Velaryon [/b] of Driftmark and [b] Crispian Celtigar [/b] of Claw Isle in the 1066 bookmark. The three islands have been added to the map where the Thames meets the North Sea because it reminded me of their placement in Blackwater Bay.

[h1] Features [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Three islands added south-east of England: Dragonstone, Driftmark, and Claw Isle.
    [*]Valyrian culture including: Heritage, language, name list, custom icon, and a custom tradition called Valyrian 
       Legacy.
    [*]Valyrian religion including: custom holy sites, custom unreformed/reformed icons, custom doctrine to allow 2 
       wives, custom tenet to make inter-faith marriage possible, custom god names and priest names.
    [*]Decision and events called the Four Kingdoms which has 5 stages: The first decision gives claims on the Kingdom 
       of England as it is in 1066, gives 3000 troops so you can instantly declare war, and gives 4500 prestige so you can 
       press all your claims without penalties to your fame. The stages after gives claims to the kingdoms of Wales, 
       Ireland and Scotland, in that order. The final stage after conquering all the kingdoms creates a new empire title 
       called [b] New Valyria [/b]. The whole chain also gives enough dynasty prestige to unlock an entire row of perks.

       Decision once London has been conquered to rename it to King's Landing, make it your capital, and 
       convert its culture and faith to Valyrian.
    [*]Four traits with custom icons:
       [b] Dragonrider [/b]: 80% chance to inherit, modifiers to opinion, prestige, combat, dread. Also unlocks the casus 
       belli type that let's you press multiple claims in the same war.
       [b] Valyrian Blood [/b]: 100% chance to inherit. Change your appearance and turns your hair white and eyes violet. 
       Reduces inbreeding chance by 100%.
       [b] Dragonseed [/b]: Currently only used as a custom bastard trait for Orys Baratheon for flavour.
       [b] Shadowbinder [/b]: Currently not really used for anything, I had some ideas but abandoned it to work on more 
       important things. Planning to make this connected with the Bloodmagic tenet somehow but not sure yet.
    [*]Two custom MAA-regiments with custom art:
       [b] Dragon [/b]: Recruitable with the [b] Dragon rider [/b] trait. Incredibly overpowered for both sieges and 
       battles. It's capped at 1 regiment and it's also capped at 1 unit, this is a bit problematic as MAA regiments spawn in 
       with 5 units without modding defines.
       [b] Dragonkeepers [/b]: Recruitable with Valyrian culture. Very strong Heavy Infantry unit.
    [*]Four custom artifacts with custom icons:
       [b] Blackfyre [/b] and [b] Dragon Egg [/b] which are added to Aegon on game start. Blackfyre has prowess and they 
       both have modifiers to opinion, prestige, dynasty prestige. Dragon Egg has no use for now besides the modifiers.
       [b] Dark Sister [/b] which is added to Visenya on game start. I don't think she equips it by herself unless she's 
       landed, not sure if I can fix that.
       [b] Conqueror's Crown [/b] this is added as part of the final decision in the Four Kingdoms chain for flavour 
       (crowned emperor of New Valyria)
    [*]Flavour titles: "Lord" instead of "Count" and "Duke" for the Valyrian faith. "Lord of the Tides" for the holder of the 
       Driftmark county.
    [*]Two custom buildings (very minor): Obsidian Mine for Dragonstone which gives Aegon a ridiculous amount of 
       gold. Also made a building called Dragon Pit but I haven't really done anything with this.
    [*]Six custom Houses and Dynasties with custom CoAs, and mottos (if) given in lore:
       [b] House Velaryon [/b] for Driftmark with some family members. Made the Lord of the Tides Aegon's steward. 
       Ships aren't a very large part of CK3 at the moment.
       [b] House Celtigar [/b] for Claw Isle and Aegon's first master of coin.
       [b] House Baratheon [/b] for Orys, Aegon's (rumored) bastard half-brother and first hand of the king.
       [b] House Qoherys [/b] Quenton Qoherys was master-at-arms at Dragonstone.
       [b] House Massey [/b] Triston Massey, Aegon's first master of laws. 
       [b] House Bar Emmon [/b] the Bar Emmons supported Aegon instead of House Durrandon of Storm's End. No info 
       on any specific Bar Emmons so I made a character called Togarion after their founder so I could add a spymaster.
[/list]

[h1] Planned Features [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Iron Islands with Ironborn culture and Drowned God faith, possibly west of Ireland(?)
    [*]Possibly do something with the 867 date, not sure what this would be (I really shouldn't have started the conquest 
       at 1066 (ideas welcomed).
    [*]Do something with the Shadowbinder trait and the Bloodmagic tenet (ideas welcomed).
[/list]

Any problems can be reported in the comments and I'll try my best to help. You can report compatibility problems in the comments as well if it's something you feel you can't live without, please list the mod(s) in this case and I might take a look at it.

Thanks and have fun!
