She believed that she had a strong claim to the throne as the oldest surviving child of King Viserys, and she was supported by several powerful loyalists. \n\nHowever, her half-brother Aegon II Targaryen, also known as Aegon the Elder, also claimed the throne, leading to a brutal conflict between the Black and the Green factions of House Targaryen. \n\nRhaenyra ultimately died during the war, but her legacy lived on as her son, Aegon III Targaryen, also known as Aegon the Younger, eventually ascended to the Iron Throne."
